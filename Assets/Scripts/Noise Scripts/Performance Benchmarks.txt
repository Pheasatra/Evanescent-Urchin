Stress Test w/
4 Octaves (Noise calculated 4 times and layered at higher and higher frequency)
10,404 Noise values 
9,216 Vertices

Frame times for reference
Time per frame = 1 / 165 = 6ms
Time per frame = 1 / 60 = 16ms
				
Simplex Calculations per second
10,404 * 165 = 1,716,660 * 4 Octaves = 6,866,640 (holy s@*t!)
10,404 * 60 = 624,240 * 4 Octaves = 2,496,960

Each Simplex calculation has about 20 expensive functions worth of calculations in them (FastFloor*2, Grad*4, If*5, Add*20, Sub*15, Multi*35) (estimate)
Probably good to limit this to around 1 million make sure everyone can play it in webGL especially

3D
FastNoise2 (SIMD) 	= 2.53ms
Simplex (Mine) 		= 7.04ms
OpenSimplex 		= 8.76ms
SimplexNoise 		= 10.49ms
FastNoiseLite 		= 13.58ms

2D
FastNoise2 (SIMD) 	= 2.17ms
OpenSimplex 		= 6.08ms  :  5.19ms using Noise2_UnskewedBase()
SimplexNoise 		= 7.58ms
FastNoiseLite 		= 10.83ms
Simplex (Mine)		= N/A

WebGL does not support Compute shaders, Multithreading(it semi-works), or SIMD. (Normal shaders work though but I need the data CPU side for buoyancy calculations and procedural textures are pain)
Because of this everything (except possibly audio & physics (the aforementioned semi-works in question)) has to be done on the main thread and any hiccups above 6-16 ms worth of frame time 
will hang everything.
