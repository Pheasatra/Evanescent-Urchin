Stress Test w/
4 Octaves (Noise calculated 4 times and layered at higher and higher frequency)
10,404 Noise values 
9,216 Vertices

Frame times for reference
Time per frame = 1 / 165 = 6ms    // target
Time per frame = 1 / 60 = 16ms
				
Simplex Calculations per second
10,404 * 165 = 1,716,660 * 4 Octaves = 6,866,640 (holy s@*t!)
10,404 * 60 = 624,240 * 4 Octaves = 2,496,960

Each Simplex calculation has about 20 expensive functions worth of calculations in them (FastFloor*2, Grad*4, If*5, Add*20, Sub*15, Multi*35) (estimate)
Probably good to limit this to around 1 million make sure everyone can play it in webGL especially, could also switch to gerstener waves and bump up the octaves as it is far cheaper (Sine, Pow, Add*3)

WebGL does not support Compute shaders, Multithreading(it semi-works), or SIMD. (Normal shaders work though), so everything runs on the main thread
